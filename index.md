# Hello!
I ~~was~~ *still* **am** Madhoolika Chodavarapu. A lost Computer Science student 
at UCSD, trying to finish my first CSE 110 assignment *sigh*
Yesterday our professor said > SE is not all about coding
So here is me trying to make this sound non-nerd
I imagine git to be an old grandpa trying to give up suggestions to make our lives easy, but rather their suggestions seem outdated and boring and *slightly* irritating, but hey SE world loves Granpa git, so should I. 
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
(Copied directly from [Granpa's own website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax))

Or maybe you prefer a direct link to the section [Section link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code)

Here is how I feel about this assignment ![hehe](https://www.essex.ac.uk/-/media/images/blogs/posts/2017-04-07-meme-5.jpg)

I baked **SOME CUPCAKES ** for my friend yesterday, so here is how it went
1. Took cake mix
2. Read instructions
3. Ignored the instructions and threw the box away 
4. Took some cake mix 
5. Poured in milk and hope 
6. Mixed until my hand hurt 
7. Dumped it gently into a cupcake mould 
8. Checked it into my instant pot cause I dont have an oven 
9. Pressure cooked it for 19 mins 
10. Put come icing on it until it covered up all of my mistakes 
    
Hey they did turn out to ~~be cute~~ look cute, not sure about the taste 
If you want to see how they look, follow the procedure below:
- Follow me on my instagram (I wont give you my id, Sherlock Holmes)
* Subscribe to my youtube (I dont have one)
+ Send me $50

Ending my assignment with some self-care chechlick for you:

- [ ] Had breakfast?
- [ ] Showered
- [ ] Spoke to a few humans
- [ ] Took a stroll outside (touched grass)
- [ ] Had lunch 
- [ ] Smiled at least once (bare minimum, come on)
- [ ] Gave this student a 100% on her finals for CSE 110



Thank you!!
(SOrry this assignment was so trash, but it has all the componenets it needs to have I swear)
